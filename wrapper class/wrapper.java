      Wrapper class are the some inbuilt clases which are used to for perform conversion purpose.
      1. There are 3 types of conversion in JAVA
          a) Primitive type of conversion :-those conversion perform between simple data type called as primitive type of conversion.
                   There are 2 types of conversion in primitive data type 
                        1. Implicit conversion :- means those conversions perform automatically by compiler called as implicit ..
                                               means when we put the larger type of data at left hand side and smaller type of data right hand side then compiler is able to
                                            perform conversion automatically called as implicit conversion.
          b) Primitive to reference and reference to Primitive :- Those conversions perform between primitive to reference and reference to primitive.
          c) Reference to Reference :- Those conversions perform between reference to reference called referential conversion.
